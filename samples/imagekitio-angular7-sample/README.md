# Imagekit Angular 7 Sample

This project shows the usage of ImageKit Angular SDK in an Angular 7 app. Please note that you need to have `@angular/cli v7.*.*` installed to run this application. You can install that version locally by running this command in the folder for this sample application:


```sh
> npm install
```

## Running the application

Before you can use Imagekit SDK, you need to provide config values required in `app.module.ts` and `app.component.ts`. You can either configure your environment and take values from there, or directly provide in respective files.

To start the application, use `npm start` command.
